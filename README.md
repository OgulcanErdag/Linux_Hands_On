# 🐧 Linux Hands-On Practices

This repository contains structured **Linux hands-on exercises** created to build and strengthen real-world Linux administration and shell scripting skills.  
Each folder represents a single lab session (`Linux-01`, `Linux-02`, etc.), including step-by-step terminal practice in the `LAB.md` file.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is dedicated exclusively to **hands-on Linux practice**.  
It is not a theoretical note collection, but a workspace for:

- Practicing fundamental and advanced Linux commands
- Managing users, files, and permissions
- Learning automation with shell scripting
- Using filters, operators, `sed`, `awk`, and cron jobs
- Building a strong foundation for DevOps and Cloud Engineering

---

## 🧩 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to one Linux topic:

Linux-01 : Managing Files in Linux
📁 Linux-02 : Linux Environment Variables
📁 Linux-03 : Managing Users and Groups
📁 Linux-04 : Filters and Control Operators
📁 Linux-05 : sed & awk command and crontab
📁 Linux-06 : Shell Scripting Basics
📁 Linux-07 : Shell Scripting / Conditional Statements
📁 Linux-08 : Shell Scripting / Loops
📁 Linux-09 : Shell Scripting / Functions

Each folder contains:

- `LAB.md` → step-by-step lab instructions
- (optional) `scripts/` → bash or automation scripts
- (optional) `screenshots/` → output verification images
